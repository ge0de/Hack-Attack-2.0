## Inspiration
Struggles in picturing and conceptualizing vectors and matrices in university-level Linear Algebra courses. 

## What it does
It visually calculates and displays results of vector addition, subtraction, multiplication, cross product, dot product, displaying the span of R3, and displaying the net area volume.

## How we built it
Languages/Libraries used: Python, streamlit, numpy, plotly.
After creating a dashboard on streamlit to visualize our product, we built the important features of the dashboard along with scroll wheels, text boxes, and other aids to boost customizability.

## Challenges we ran into
GitHub collaboration, installing necessary libraries, finding useful resources online to help with unexpected errors, and mainly figuring out how to use numpy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Putting our idea into code and making it reality; Adding extra features.

## What we learned
Teamwork, GitHub Repository & Version Control System Management, Learning people's strengths and distributing the workload appropriately.

## What's next for Matrix/Vector Visualizer
Putting it on a website or the app store for students to freely benefit from.
